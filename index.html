    <h2><b>ABOUT ME</b></h2>
    <p>I am probably considered to be nearing the end of my IT career, rather than 
        just starting my career, as most of the other students are doing.
        But I like a challenge and new tech, so here I am, learning another language and 
         some more web skills.</p>

    <p>I consider myself to be very privileged to have worked through the era of huge and 
        mind blowing developments in the computer industry - I started in 1982 as a computer 
        operator at the South African Reserve Bank, after passing a logic test - I was actually
        going to go study commercial art in the new year.... 
        The computer we worked on, and its "new" friend...not much smaller...were housed in a 
        room probably the size of an average, modern one bedroomed apartment! 
        These were mainframes, and they even had their own engineer, onsite, <em>all the way from
        the US!!</em>
    </p>

    <p>I'm a tech at heart and not overly fond of just pure development work, but love
        being a maintenance and support person - whether on file servers, warehouse management
        systems, retail systems or even marketing systems. 
        My main goal is to always keep production stable and secure.
        I love to learn new tech and love systems such as the voice directed picking system used
         in a warehouse....so I guess robotics and AI are probably my new best friends. 
    <p>
